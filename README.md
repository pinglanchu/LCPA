# LCPA

This depository is crated for paper titled "Network-energy-based predictability and Link-corrected prediction in complex networks".

Networks data is contained in the folder Data, and the Figures folder contains pictures appeared in the paper.

The main method is completed in the LCPA.py. As for each network, we has explored the optimal parameters for LCPA.

In some other executable python files, we have computed the LCPA's precision by the LCPA.py firstly to avoid the replication computation.
